#What is Blackspotter?

Blackspotter is an android application that warns drivers as they approach a point on a road that might pose danger to their life. It is able to warn about:  
1. Accident Black Spots  
2. Accident scenes  
3. Danger zones (e.g. loose chippings, rolling stones, seasonal rivers, etc)

Drivers can also set a destination and from their current location, a route is drawn to the destination and the number of **Blackspots**, **Accident scenes** and **Danger zones** are given!

#Who can use it?
Best for drivers but anyone can use it to determine the condition of their current route. Really, anyone can use **Blackspotter**
